### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Streamlit 1.28.0 for interactive web application
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.0.3, NumPy 1.24.3
- **Visualization**: Plotly 5.17.0 for interactive charts
- **Statistical Analysis**: SciPy 1.11.1 for A/B testing and forecasting
- **Data Generation**: Custom synthetic data generator for demonstration

### Data Model
The dashboard works with three main data sources:
1. **Daily Marketing Metrics**: Campaign performance data with spend, conversions, and revenue
2. **Customer Data**: Segment information, lifetime value, and behavioral metrics
3. **A/B Test Results**: Experiment data with statistical significance calculations

## Key Metrics & Calculations

### Performance Metrics
- **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend): `Revenue / Spend`
- **CPA** (Cost Per Acquisition): `Spend / Conversions`
- **CTR** (Click-Through Rate): `Clicks / Impressions`
- **Conversion Rate**: `Conversions / Clicks`

### Customer Metrics
- **LTV** (Lifetime Value): `Avg Purchase Value × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan`
- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost): `Total Spend / New Customers`
- **Churn Risk Score**: Probability-based scoring from 0-1

### Attribution Models
- Last-touch attribution (default)
- Linear attribution
- Time-decay attribution
