# Customer Churn Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a telecommunications company to identify key factors that lead to customer attrition. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, we uncover insights that can help reduce churn rate by 15-20%.

## Business Context
Customer churn is a critical metric for subscription-based businesses. Understanding why customers leave helps companies develop targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Findings
1. **Contract Type Impact**: Month-to-month contracts show 42% churn rate vs. 11% for yearly contracts
2. **Service Usage Patterns**: Customers using fewer than 3 services are 2.5x more likely to churn
3. **Payment Method Correlation**: Electronic check users have highest churn (45%) compared to other payment methods (15-20%)
4. **Tenure Effect**: 50% of churn occurs within first 12 months of service
